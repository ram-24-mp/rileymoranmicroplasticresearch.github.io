What are microplastics?
Microplastics are particles between 5mm and 1um made from syththetic polymers (plastics) [1]. They occur in several different morphologies,  including fragments, fibers, films, foams, and pellets/beads [2].
Why do we care about microplastics in freshwater?
Microplastics are ubiquitous in our food, water, and air [3]. Scientists have also observed them in virtually every human tissue [4]. There are growing concerns microplastic exposure may represent a threat to public health [5]. Since many routes of exposure ultimately depend on microplastic transport by freshwater systems, elucidating microplastic behavior in freshwater systems is critical to managing and mitigating human microplastic exposure.">

<p><strong>What are microplastics?</strong></p>
<p>Microplastics are particles between 5mm and 1um made from syththetic polymers (plastics) [1]. They occur in several different morphologies,  including fragments, fibers, films, foams, and pellets/beads [2].</p>
<p><strong>Why do we care about microplastics in freshwater?</strong></p>
<p>Microplastics are ubiquitous in our food, water, and air [3]. Scientists have also observed them in virtually every human tissue [4]. There are growing concerns microplastic exposure may represent a threat to public health [5]. Since many routes of exposure ultimately depend on microplastic transport by freshwater systems, elucidating microplastic behavior in freshwater systems is critical to managing and mitigating human microplastic exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Why develop new techniques and equipment?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Neuston net tow methods produce significant underestimates and high degrees of uncertainty [6]</li>
<li>Many sample processing techniques are time consuming [7] and constrain the total numer of samples processed, limiting spatiotemporal resolution</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hypotheses">Hypotheses</h2>
<p><strong>Microplastics in Surface Waters:</strong></p>
<p>Short-term variability (days to weeks) in microplastic concentrations in the surface waters of  rivers,  lakes, and reservoirs are principally controlled by:</p>
<ol>
<li>upstream riverine bed sediment resuspension and erosion (positively correlated)</li>
<li>biofouling/aggregation (negatively correlated)</li>
<li>discharge/flow velocity (riverine settings-positively correlated)</li>
</ol>
<p>These factors can be measured via total suspended sediment (TSS), chlorophyll  fluorescence/particulate organic matter (POM), and USGS river gauges, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Microplastics in Bed Sediments:</strong></p>
<p>Microplastics in bed sediments are a proxy for past microplastic fluxes and track long-term variability (years to decades). They are principally controlled by the areal extent of plastic-intensive land use categories:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Developed Land (positively correlated)</li>
<li>Cropland (positively correlated)</li>
</ol>
