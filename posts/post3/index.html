Jordan Lake is an artificial reservoir dammed in the early 80s as flood control for Fort Liberty. In the decades since, it has taken on a more vital role for local communities-as a recreational site and as a water source for Cary, NC. Jordan lake is primary fed (~80% of inflows) by the Haw River.

<p>The land use of Jodan Lake&rsquo;s watershed has also shifted in those years. Local communities have grown significantly at the expense of forested land cover-particularly on the lake&rsquo;s eastern margins. A dynamic, urbanized watershed like this will allow me to examine both short-term drivers of microplastic spatiotemporal variation, and the longer-term variations driven by chnages in the watershed.</p>
<p><strong>Microplastics</strong>

<p>A preliminary sample (3L) collected on October 31st from the Haw River at Bynum shows microplastic concentrations are ~9 particles/L.</p>
